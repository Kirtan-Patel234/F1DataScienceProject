# F1 Data Science Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for my F1 Data Science project, where we placed **2nd out of 25 participants** in the Data Dive competition for the Illinois Data Science Club.

---

## Project Overview

The F1 Data Science Project analyzes Formula 1 racing data from **2019-2023**, including telemetry, weather conditions, grid positions, pit stops, and tire choices. The goal is to build a predictive model for optimizing race strategies based on initial conditions.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Collected F1 telemetry and race data from 2019-2023.
- **Data Processing:** Cleaned, preprocessed, and formatted large datasets for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted key features such as lap times, weather impact, and pit stop efficiency.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Built machine learning models to forecast optimal race strategies.
- **Visualization:** Created insightful visualizations for performance comparisons.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Sources:** F1 API, public race telemetry datasets

## Findings

Pit Stop Efficiency: Teams that optimized pit stop timing gained an average of 3-5 positions on the leaderboard.

Weather Conditions Impact: Rain had the most significant effect on lap times, increasing average lap duration by 10-15%.

Tire Strategy: Soft compound tires provided the best performance during qualifying but wore out faster during long stints, requiring more pit stops.

Grid Position Trends: Drivers starting in the top 3 positions finished on the podium in 70% of races.

Optimal Strategy Identification: The predictive model identified a combination of 2 pit stops and medium compound tires as the most consistent strategy for dry conditions.
